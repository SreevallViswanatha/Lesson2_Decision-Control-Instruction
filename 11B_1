//1.	The Marks obtained by a student in 5 different subjects are input through the keyboard. 
//The student gets a division as per the following rules:
//a.	Percentage above or equal to 60 – First division
//b.	Percentage between 50 and 59 – Second division
//c.	Percentage between 40 and 49 – Third division
//d.	Percentage less than 40 – fail.
